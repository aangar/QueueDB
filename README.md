# Project: Data Structures, personal learing repo.
### Author: **AJ Angarita**
### Project Description: A repo where I put files to work on my understanding on data structures.
### Motive: Wanted to start somewhere with data structures before formal instruction.

---

Progress Map:
- [x] Tree generation up to a specified value without exceeding.
- [x] Finding and Generating the route for a value that might not have a node.
- [x] Make an interpreter for ease-of-access to find in a tree. EX: Find the path to 100 in a Search Tree.
- [ ] User specified boundaries, generation limmits, and search values.
- [ ] Determining if a child node exists in a structured tree. Howto: Generate tree up to 49, and find out if 100 exists ( it won't )
- [ ] Making a tree based off an array / list of values.
    - [ ] Find a value in a binary tree, no order to the child nodes. Ex: Generate a tree from array [ 1,65,2,34,null,17, ... ], and find it (probably BFS or DFS)
- [ ] insert a root at a value and generate the tree from there. Ex: Get the node for a value of 58, and start a new tree starting from there with a value of 5.

What comes next?
1. Constant Tasks
    - Constant general cleanup of unused methods.
    - Searching / Generation / Algorithm Refinement.
2. Defined Tasks: Related to Binary Trees
    - Searching by Non-Nested Data Type
    - Searching by Nested Data Type ( Arrays, Lists, HashMaps, etc... )
    - Searching by field in Class, potentially.
3. Other Things
    - Other data structure work can go here.
    - Make files for best practices, development ideas.

Topics to Research

1. Self Balancing Tree.
2. Balanced Tree.
3. DFS / BFS.
4. Insertion Methods.
5. Removal Methods.

Thanks for reading. Not sure how often this will update, but I can assume it will.

Eventually.
