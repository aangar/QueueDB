What has been done so far?
- [x] Tree generation up to a specified value without exceeding.
- [ ] Searching for values to see if they exist.
- [ ] Route generation for an existing value.
- [ ] Making a tree based off an array / list of values.

What comes next?
1. Constant Tasks
    - Constant general cleanup of unused methods.
    - Searching / Generation / Algorithm Refinement.
2. Defined Tasks: Related to Binary Trees
    - Searching by Non-Nested Data Type
    - Searching by Nested Data Type ( Arrays, Lists, HashMaps, etc... )
    - Searching by field in Class, potentially.
3. Other Things
    - Other data structure work can go here.
    - Make files for best practices, development ideas.
